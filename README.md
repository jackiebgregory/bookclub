# bookclub
This is the back end of my final capstone project at Nashville Software School.

Motivation

For the past few years, I've worked part-time at a bookstore. The store hosts two regular book clubs, plus keeps information on other area clubs in order to stock the "Local Book Club Reads" shelves. All of that information is kept on paper, in a binder behind the front counter. I created an application that could be used to store that same information digitally.

  - The user can REGISTER with an email and a password

  - The user can DELETE  a book club meeting (only meetings the user has created)
